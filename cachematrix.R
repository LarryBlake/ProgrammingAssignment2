## R Assignment 2
## Pair of functions to:
##    1. Save a matrix / inversion pair for future retrieval
##    2. Return the inversion of a matrix, using saved calculations if possible

## Write the matrix / inversion pair for future

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Does cached solution exist?  Return it.  Otherwise invert the matrix and save.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
